# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import numpy into the editor
### Step 2: 
Input the co-ordinates to calculate the distance between them
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](https://github.com/anandarakshan/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/139217934/36a4b71b-836b-474b-8b37-6fbb3f57f06f)

### Step 4: 
Print the solution
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
l1=[10,6]
l2=[4,2]
distance=(l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2
result=round(math.sqrt(distance),2)
print(result)
```
### OUTPUT:
![python_3](https://github.com/anandarakshan/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/139217934/f63b8b09-aabb-4dfa-8816-717442714a0f)



### RESULT:
The distance between the two points is displayed successfully.
